## ODK4GTFCC - OpenDataKit 4 The Global Task Force on Cholera Control

This is a repo for distributing OpenDataKit (ODK) form templates for rapid data collection in cholera outbreak events, using mobile and browser applications that support XLSForms-based forms. These include, but are not limited to:

* ODK Collect
* GeoODK
* enketo
* Esri Survey123?

## What's Here  
### (not much yet, but I've got plans.)

#### ODK Collect Forms
I'll be creating and testing for functionality for the next few weeks, but the library of form templates should be complete, soon. 

#### Tutorial Materials
I'll put together some step-by-step tutorial materials for implementing these forms in the most common ODK based apps. I'll try to test on a few platforms, including all of those listed above, to provide some flexibility.

#### Tips & Tricks
I'll list some best practices when choosing, setting up and managing  equipment for data collection, as well as other topics, like encryption, etc...

## Source Material

This work is based directly upon the World Health Organization (WHO) [Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC)](http://www.who.int/cholera/task_force/en/) publication, "[Guidance on cholera surveillance.](http://www.who.int/entity/cholera/task_force/GTFCC-Guidance-cholera-surveillance.pdf?ua=1)" [[http://www.who.int/entity/cholera/task_force/GTFCC-Guidance-cholera-surveillance.pdf?ua=1](http://www.who.int/entity/cholera/task_force/GTFCC-Guidance-cholera-surveillance.pdf?ua=1)].  

Where possible, all ODK forms mimic those found in the *Annex* sections of the "Guidance on cholera surveillance" publication. In some cases, the order of inputs has been altered to make optimal use of ODK features. 

## Updates and User Input
As the forms in the "Guidance on cholera surveillance" publication annex are listed as "Examples" this initial set of templates is intended as a first attempt to operationalize the WHO GTFCC Guidelines for the ODK Collect platform.

Anyone who finds these templates useful is encouraged to contact me, directly, at **stacemaples(@)stanford.edu** and let me know how you are implementing the project. 

For issues with the forms, themselves, please submit an issue through Github, or fork, fix and pull request the issue, yourself. 

I am entirely open to working with on-the-ground agencies to provide initial implementation assistance, training and collaboration.
